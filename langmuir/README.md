This case demonstrates the use of a KPP-based Langmuir turbulence parameterization described in Li and Fox-Kemper (2017) via CVMix. Surface forcing data is from the [Ocean Weather Station Papa (OWS Papa)](https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/ocs/Papa) and Stokes drift is computed from the surface wave spectrum collected at the Waverider Mooring at the same site by [APL-UW](https://apl.uw.edu/project/project.php?id=ows-p). See Section 3.2 of Li et al. (2021) for more information on this case.

The maximum simulation time allowed by the included forcing data is March 21, 2012 - March 20, 2013, covering one annual cycle at OWS Papa. Surface forcing and T/S profiles are provided at hourly frequency. Both surface Stokes drift and Stokes drift profile are provided roughly every half an hour. Note that there is a data gap between September 21, 2012 and October 4, 2012 in the Stokes drift.
