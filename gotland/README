These simulations are made for the location of station 271 Central Eastern
Gotland Sea of the Baltic Sea at 20 deg E and 57.3 deg N with a water depth 
of 250 m. Initial conditions for temperature and salinity are derived from 
measurements. Meteorological forcing was available from the ERA15 reanalysis 
data set. For the penetration of solar radiation into the water column, fairly 
turbid water (Jerlov type IB) is assumed. Salinity concentrations are nudged 
to observations with a time scale of 2 days.

The simulation is carried out for the years 1980-1990.
For the discretisation, the water column has been
divided into 100 vertical layers, with a strong zooming towards the surface,
resulting in a mean near-surface resolution of less than 0.5 m.
The time step for these simulations is set to 10 minutes.
