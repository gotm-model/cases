This scenario is a classical scenario for the Northern Pacific, for which
long term observations of meteorological parameters
and temperature profiles are available. The station Papa at 145 deg W,
50 deg N has the advantage that it is situated in a region where the horizontal
advection of heat and salt is assumed to be small. Various authors used these 
data for validating turbulence closure schemes.

The way how bulk formulae for the surface momentum and heat fluxes
have been used here is discussed in detail in Burchard et al. (1999).

The maximum simulation time allowed by the included surface forcing file 
and the temperature profile file
is January 1 (17.00 h), 1960 - December 31 (12.00 h), 1968.
In this scenario, the simulation time is run from
March 25, 1961 (0.00 h) to March 25, 1962 (0.00 h).
