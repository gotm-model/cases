The GOTM test setups can be run either via the command line or via the
GOTM-GUI.

In the first case the following Makefile targets are available:
namelist	! will create a default namelist based on values in <setup>.xml
run		! will build the executable, make a link and run the model	
scenario	! will pack everything needed for a gui run
example		! will make a .tar.gz file with necessary files
clean		! will remove some files
realclean	! will remove more files
distclean	! will remove everthing that can't be automatically genereated

The above Makefile targets are available in the main directory (the directory
with this REAME) and in the individual test case directories. If made
from this directory 'make' will loop over the cases that are ready according 
to READY_CASES.

To run with the GUI simply do:
<path_to_gui>/gotmgui.py <name>.gotmscenario

Please report any issues to gotm-users@googlegroups.com


IMPORTANT: for some of the actions you must have 'editscenario.py' in your 
path. You can get editscenario.py from:
ftp://bbh.homelinux.net/pub/jorn.bruggeman/getmschema/editscenario.py
